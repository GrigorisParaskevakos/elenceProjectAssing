    <h3>Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR</h3>
    <p>If you want a single lens that can cover every imaginable shooting situation, from wide-angle groups to ultra-high-power zoom shots, look no further than the new AF-S DX NIKKOR 18–300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR. Boasting the longest reach of any NIKKOR all-in-one
        zoom lens, it delivers the equivalent of 450mm—enough reach to bring the most distant action up close. Nikon's second generation VR II technology ensures every photo and HD video is razor-sharp, and Nikon's advancements in lens design deliver
        consistent, exceptional performance in any setting. It's also great for close-up shooting. Even more amazing, the AF-S NIKKOR 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR does all this in a surprisingly compact, lightweight lens.</p>

    <h3>Tokina AF 100mm F2.8 AT-X M100 AF PRO D</h3>
    <p>The AT-X 100 PRO D is a new macro lens capable of life-sized (1:1) reproduction at 11.8 in. (30 cm). The lens' multi-coating have been re-engineered to match the highly reflective silicon based CCD and CMOS sensors in today's digital SLR cameras.
        This lens gives the best of both worlds because optics still give full coverage and excellent sharpness on 35mm film. A macro lens that can handle both the digital and film worlds with ease. The AT-X 100 PRO D also has a very convenient focus
        limiter switch that can lock the focus out of the closes focus making it focus faster when used as a moderate telephoto lens that is excellent portraits as well.</p>
